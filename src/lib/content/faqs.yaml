- q: "Why can't I see my post on the map?"
  a: >
    <p>In 99.9% of cases, it is because it has not been reviewed by our
    moderation team yet. All posts are moderated by a small group of
    volunteers before appearing publicly on the map, in order to ensure
    they do not contain breaches of anonymity, hate speech, or
    spam/advertising. Rest assured that your post will be visible as
    soon as we reach it in the moderation queue.</p>

- q: 'Can I delete my post?'
  a: >
    <p>Yes, of course! To delete your post, please email the text of the
    post you would like deleted to <a href="mailto:hi@queeringthemap.com">hi@queeringthemap.com</a> with the subject line 'Delete My Post'.</p>

- q: 'How can I become a moderator?'
  a: >
    <p>We are always welcoming new volunteer moderators to our team. For
    information on upcoming moderator onboarding sessions, please email
    us at <a href="mailto:hi@queeringthemap.com">hi@queeringthemap.com</a>.</p>
