        <div class="overlay__section-text">
          <p>
            This platform is dedicated to documenting and supporting resistance
            against the digital infrastructures of US-driven border
            externalization, militarization and policing, which extend state
            violence and surveillance far beyond physical state boundaries. We
            collaborate with communities, researchers, and activists to
            challenge these infrastructures of violence and to amplify voices
            pushing back against the expansion of this digital border and work
            towards a future where freedom of movement is a reality for all.
          </p>

          <p>
            In confronting the pervasive digital infrastructures that constitute
            The Everywhere Border, resistance must rise against the insidious
            technologies that perpetuate exclusion, surveillance, and state and
            corporate violence beyond physical frontiers. These border
            technologies embed themselves deeply into everyday life and across
            global migration routes, marking individuals for control and
            containment under the guise of (national) security. The border today
            is no longer a mere geographical line but a sprawling, ideological
            system encoded onto bodies and data.
          </p>

          <p>
            Resistance must reclaim these contested techno-borderscapes by
            dismantling the systems that enable ruthless profiling,
            racialization, and dehumanization. This involves unmasking how
            digital migration control infrastructures serve corporate and state
            interests—entwined with neocolonial logics—to enforce violent and
            exclusionary regimes. Such resistance is necessarily transnational,
            weaving solidarity across communities from the frontlines of
            migration to urban centers, breaking down the silos often imposed by
            borders and institutional divides.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is what we are trying to do with this map, to help connect the
            dots, and foster a realization that we are not alone in our
            struggles.
          </p>

          <h2>Land Acknowledgment</h2>
          <div class="overlay__section-text">
            <p>
              Queering the Map was initiated on the unceded traditional lands of
              the Kanien'kehá:ka Nation. The island currently called “Montreal”
              is known as Tiohtia:ke in the language of the Kanien'kehá:ka, and
              it has historically been a meeting place for other Indigenous
              nations.
            </p>

            <p>
              A queer approach to space points out the limitations of the ways
              in which the world around us is produced and normalized by and for
              certain bodies and not others. It is pertinent that we
              continuously reflect and act on the ways in which LGBTQIA+ life is
              complicit in ongoing processes of settler-colonialism. How does
              race, gender, sexuality, citizenship, ability, and class affect
              the ways in which we relate to, move through, and create space? As
              a pin on Queering the Map in Honolulu, Hawaii attests: “queer
              liberation must mean decolonization, and decolonization must mean
              queer liberation.”
            </p>

            <p>

              you can support Indigenous communities in the fight for
              sovereignty.

            enforce any its terms. These Terms are governed by the laws of the
            province of Ontario. You and we both agree to the exclusive
            jurisdiction and venue of the provincial and federal courts of
            Ontario and stipulate to the fairness and convenience of proceedings
            in such courts for all disputes arising out of or relating to use of
            the Queering the Map Services.
          </p>

          <h2>13. Force Majeure</h2>
          <p>
            Force majeure means any cause or event beyond the reasonable control
            of the affected party including without limitation war, civil war,
            armed conflict or terrorist attack, nuclear, chemical or biological
            contamination, pandemic, strikes, civil action, unavailability of
            the internet, unscheduled hosting and maintenance to systems, power
            and data losses and acts of God. We shall not be obliged to perform
            our obligations under these Terms to the extent that we are
            prevented from doing so by reason of an event of force majeure.
            Performance of these Terms may cease during the continuation of the
            force majeure event and for such time after that event ceases as is
            necessary for us to start satisfying our obligations again. For so
            long as such force majeure event is continuing, our corresponding
            obligations under these Terms shall be suspended to the same extent.
            If such force majeure continues for a continuous period in excess of
            four months, we may terminate access to the Queering the Map
            Services immediately on service of notice to you.

          <p><small>Last Updated on April 15, 2024</small></p>

          <p>
            This Privacy Policy outlines the collection, use, disclosure, and
            protection of your information when you access and use our platform.
            Your privacy is crucial to us, and we are committed to maintaining
            the confidentiality and security of the information you provide. By
            using Queering the Map, you acknowledge that you have read and
            understood this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the platform
            constitutes acceptance of any updates or changes to this policy. If
            you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, do not use Queering the
            Map.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
          <p>
            User Content: Users may voluntarily provide User Content, such as
            personal stories, experiences, and other content, in text format.
          </p>
          <p>
            Location Data: Users may voluntarily select a location on the map
            where they would like their User Content to appear. We do not
            collect information about users' actual location.
          </p>
          <p>
            Time Data: We collect the time that a user's submission is made.
            This is so that we can organize submissions chronologically in our
            database.
          </p>

          <!-- <p>
            Email Addresses: We collect user’s email addresses if they directly
            contact us through email, or use the Request for Removal form. We do
            not collect email addresses when a user submits User Content. We do
            not share email addresses with any third parties.
          </p> -->
          <h2>2. Use of Information</h2>
          <p>
            Platform Functionality: We use the information collected to provide
            and improve the functionality of Queering the Map, allowing users to
            share and explore LGBTQ2IA+ experiences globally.
          </p>

          <p>
            Research and Dissemination: We may analyze and use aggregated,
            non-personal data for research and artistic purposes to enhance the
            platform's overall experience and mission.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Disclosure of Information</h2>
          <p>
            Anonymity: Users contribute anonymously if they choose not to
            associate their contributions with identifiable information. Users
            cannot create accounts, so no usernames, passwords, phone numbers,
            email addresses or social media handles are associated with
            contributions. We moderate all contributions for breaches of
            anonymity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Legal Compliance: We may disclose information in response to legal
            processes or when required to comply with applicable laws,
            regulations, or government requests.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
          <p>
            Queering the Map may use third-party services for analytics,
            hosting, and other functionalities. These services may have their
            own privacy policies, and users are encouraged to review them.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Security</h2>
          <p>
            We implement reasonable measures to protect the information we
            collect from unauthorized access, disclosure, or alteration.
            However, no data transmission over the internet is entirely secure,
            and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
          </p>

          <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
          <p>
            Queering the Map is intended for users aged 13 and older. We do not
            knowingly collect information from individuals under the age of 13.
          </p>

          <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

          <p>
            We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any
            time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the
            updated Privacy Policy on the platform.
